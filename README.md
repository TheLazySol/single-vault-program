# single-vault-program
This is a custom solana program known as a "single-vault" program that only rewards one spl-token reward. 


# What is a Vault?
A "Vault" is a custom Solana program that acts as a savings account for participating token programs and behaves similarly to a staking program. A Vault rewards users and spl-token projects by paying out depositors, providing project sustainability, and creating spl-token utility.
